Executing a C program in the Kali Linux terminal is pretty straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open the Terminal:**
   - You can open the terminal by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T` or searching for "Terminal" in the applications menu.

2. **Create a C Program:**
   - You can use any text editor available in Kali Linux, such as `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit`. For simplicity, let's use `nano`.
   - To create a file and open it in `nano`, type:
     ```bash
     nano your_program.c
     ```
   - This will open the `nano` editor. Write your C program here. For example:
     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main() {
         printf("Hello, World!\n");
         return 0;
     }
     ```

3. **Save and Exit the Editor:**
   - In `nano`, you can save the file by pressing `Ctrl+O` (write out) and then press `Enter`. To exit `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`.

4. **Compile the Program:**
     ```
   - Compile the program by typing:
     ```bash
     gcc your_program.c -o your_program
     ```
   - Here, `your_program.c` is your source file and `-o your_program` specifies the output file name (`your_program`).

5. **Run the Program:**
   - After successful compilation, run your program by typing:
     ```bash
     ./your_program
     ```

6. **Example of Complete Process:**
   - Here's a summary of the commands:
     ```bash
     nano your_program.c
     # (Write the C program in the editor)
     # (Save and exit the editor)
     gcc your_program.c -o your_program
     ./your_program
     ```

Now, you should see the output of your C program in the terminal. If you encounter any issues or have more questions, feel free to ask!
